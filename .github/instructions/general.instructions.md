* IMPORTANT: Whenever making any change, update the README.md file to reflect the change, and update the DETAILS.md file with any relevant details, to prevent knowledge loss.
* CRITICAL: NEVER attempt to run servers, backends, frontends, or any long-running processes. They are asynchronous and will be non-functional in this environment.
* Do not try to run the servers. They are asynchronous, and will simply be un-runnable
* Do not run the backend
* Do not run the frontend
* Do not start development servers or any processes that would normally run continuously
* Focus on code changes, file modifications, and documentation updates only
